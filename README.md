# Olive Oil Sales Analytics Engineering Project

This project dives into sales data for olive oil products, exploring patterns, trends, and geographic insights across the United States. 
Using **Python, SQLite3, Excel, and Tableau**, I created an ETL pipeline and an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover valuable business insights.

### Business Challenge: 
Sales trends for olive oil products vary across states and timeframes. Understanding regional sales performance, customer behavior, and seasonal trends is crucial for optimizing business strategies, forecasting demand, and improving supply chain efficiency.

### Problem Statement: 
How can we leverage data-driven insights to optimize sales strategies, analyze demand trends, and improve geographic sales forecasting?

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on the end-to-end workflow of preparing, cleaning, and analyzing data to deliver actionable insights. Specifically:
- **Python** - was used to build a streamlined ETL pipeline that cleans, transforms, and prepares data for analysis.
- **SQLite3** - was used to store and query the cleaned data for efficient management and exploration.
- **Excel** - was used to process and format raw data.
- **Tableau** - was used to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes:
  - Total sales by state.
  - Monthly sales trends over time.
  - Performance by product category and customer type.

##  Key Insights

-  **State-Level Sales**: Texas recorded the highest sales volume across all three years, followed by California.
  -  **Actionable Insight:** Marketing spend should be optimized toward high-performing states while investigating the underperformance of other regions.
-  **Product Trends**: Gift baskets showed steady sales growth, especially during holiday seasons.
-  **Customer Insights**: Retail customers contributed to over 70% of total sales compared to wholesale.

##  Dataset Details

The data includes:
1. **Client Orders Table**:
   - Contains sales details such as order number, employee information, product categories, and total sales amount.
2. **Client Shipping Table**:
   - Tracks the shipping states and customer details.

Data highlights:
- **Date Range**: 2019 to 2021.
- **Key Features**: Order number, employee job title, product category, quantity, and customer state.

##  ETL Pipeline Process

1. **Extract**:
   - Read raw data from multiple CSV files using Python.
2. **Transform**:
   - Cleaned column names, handled missing values, and deduplicated records.
   - Validated data types and prepared the dataset for analysis.
3. **Load**:
   - Stored the cleaned data into a SQLite3 database for structured querying.

Key Python operations:
- Handling duplicates:
  ```python
  df_clean = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['order_number', 'order_date'])

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data cleaning, transformation, and database integration.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `sqlite3`, `numpy`
- **SQLite3**: To store and query cleaned datasets.
- **Excel**: For initial data formatting and preparation.
- **Tableau**: For building interactive dashboards to visualize trends and insights.

##  Future Work
This project can be extended to include more advanced analytics and automation. Potential future improvements include:
- Incorporate predictive analytics for forecasting sales trends.
- Automate the ETL pipeline using workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Apache Airflow).
- Integrate additional data sources for deeper insights.
